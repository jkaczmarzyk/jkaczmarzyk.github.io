      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the current increasingly digital world, it is popular to use a tablet along with a Bluetooth connected pencil for notes and presentations. These devices can be convenient and help deliver content in an efficient manner; however they also come with a few disadvantages, such as Bluetooth connectivity issues, replacement of pencil tips, and making sure the device has enough charge for the duration of its required use. For this reason, this project implements an aerial note taking program that employs MediaPipe, a Machine Learning framework,  and a convolutional neural network in order to allow a user to simply use their hand to write on a blank canvas, as the hand can be considered the most effective, general-purpose interaction tool.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spotify&#39;s Platform Effect</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The way people listen to and discover music has evolved over the years. While radio play and record stores were once a popular way to discover new music, music streaming services now account for 77% of all music consumption. Spotify is the world&amp;rsquo;s largest music streaming service provider with over 381 million monthly active users, including 172 million paying subscribers as of September 2021. Spotify recommends music in many different ways. It offers personalized playlists generated by its recommendation algorithm as well as playlists that are curated by playlist editors. These playlist editors are genre, lifestyle, and culture specialists with diverse backgrounds. One such playlist is New Music Friday (NMF), which is entirely curated by playlist editors and is updated weekly with about 100 new songs or remixes from multiple genres. There are several versions of the New Music Friday playlist for different countries, regions, and groups, such as New Music Friday Poland or New Music Friday Christian. The question looked into here is whether featuring a song on a New Music Friday playlist will cause it to become popular, compared to songs that released around the same time that are not featured on a New Music Friday playlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding music popularity is important not only for the artists who create and perform music but also for music-related industry. There have been claims of the possibility of a &amp;ldquo;hit song science&amp;rdquo; in the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) that could predict whether a song will be a hit prior to its distribution. Hit prediction can be useful to those involved in the music industry since more popular songs generate larger revenues. For this reason, it is imperative to understand the power of music streaming platforms. If Spotify playlist inclusion is found to have substantial impact on song success, music industry participants may want to focus their resources on making sure their songs appear on such a playlist. Such platform power can also bring about concerns of potential bias in the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project explores the impact of this treatment on the outcome, which is the popularity of a track over time beginning from the time it is featured on a NMF playlist and to simultaneously observe the effect of the observable covariates on both the treatment and outcome. As frequent users of Spotify, our interests exist in analyzing these insights and causal relationships to eventually deduce whether featuring a track on Spotify&amp;rsquo;s New Music Friday playlist would result in some or all tracks gaining popularity quickly as compared to all other new releases and what common audio features these tracks possess. This could also be an indicator of whether Spotify&amp;rsquo;s wide reach allows it to exert a large influence on discovering new music and the popularity of new tracks through its New Music Friday playlists. This is the motivation behind our insight-based project. While prior research has examined the effect of new releases or inclusion on Spotify-owned playlists on artist popularity, we will narrow our focus to the New Music Friday playlists and its effect on track popularity while considering the influence of audio features. Additionally, prior research has mostly stuck to using regression techniques for causal analysis while this project employs propensity score matching and the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
